# mini projects

## ideas
- calculator
  - has html, css and js in separate files.
  - uses sane way for making keypad
- rock-paper-scissors
  - with pictures
  - save scores, reset

## what I learn
- using random lib
- working with objects and iterating over them
- working more with html
- dealing with defining function closures in a loop (still need to [learn](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/JavaScript/Guide/Closures))
- some CSS
